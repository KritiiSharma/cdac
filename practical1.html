    <h1 align="center"> DIFFERENT TYPES OF NOVELS WITH DESCRIPTION</h1>

    <dl>
        <dt><b>Children's literature</b></dt>
        <dd>Children's literature targets an audience of young children, often elementary school age or younger. The
            stories commonly use simple language that young children can understand. Children's literature often
            includes moral lessons readers can gain as they finish the novel.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt><b>Detective</b></dt>
        <dd>A detective story features an investigator attempting to solve a crime, often as the main character. This
            may take place in both modern and historical settings. Often, detective characters serve in an informal
            investigator position, which can provide complicating details for the plot of the story.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Fantasy</b></dt>
        <dd>Fantasy novels take place in a world that is often similar to the real world in the present or in the past
            but adds fantasy elements such as magic, non-human characters and fantastical creatures. Low fantasy novels
            are those that feature fantasy elements in a real-world setting. In high fantasy novels, the world itself is
            a fictional realm different from that of the reader.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt><b>Horror</b></dt>
        <dd>Horror novels attempt to scare the reader, using the tension this can provide to produce interest. The
            horror may be physical, such as a story dealing with a monster that attacks people. Horror may also be
            psychological, focusing on the mental effects a situation has on a narrator or a main character.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
        <dt><b>Monster</b></dt>
        <dd>Monster stories revolve around a single monster or type of monster and their interactions with society.
            Frequently, the monsters in a monster story represent a real-world issue. An author may use a traditional
            style of monster or create their own for their story.</dd>
